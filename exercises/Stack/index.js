/**
 * Stack
 *
 * Part I:
 * Create a stack data structure. The stack
 * should be a class with methods 'push', 'pop', and
 * 'peek'.  Adding an element to the stack should
 * store it until it is removed.
 *
 * Do not use the native Array implementations of pop and push.
 *
 * Part II:
 *
 * The stack should never throw overflow errors and
 * should give a way to check the size of the stack.
 * Additionally the stack should be able to have an
 * upper limit.
 *
 * Please add specs for this on your own!
 *
 * Examples:
 * const s = new Stack();
 * s.push(1);
 * s.push(2);
 * s.pop(); // returns 2
 * s.pop(); // returns 1
 *
